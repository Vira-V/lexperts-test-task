# Task 

The task involves creating a basic version of code in React.js that allows the user to drag and drop blocks to change their order. The application should consist of a list of blocks that can be moved freely within this list.

 

In this regard, please:

 

1. Create a `DraggableBlockList` component that displays a list of draggable blocks.

2. Use React state hooks (e.g., `useState`) to manage the order of the blocks.

3. Implement the drag and drop logic that allows for changing the order of the blocks. Ensure that the UI dynamically reflects changes in order.

4. Provide basic styling so that the blocks are clearly visible and easy to drag.

 

Additional points can be earned for:

- Implementation of animations for the moving blocks.

- Adding a “Move up” and “Move down” button that allows changing the order of the blocks in the state, and at the same time the “move up” block should not work for the first element, and similarly, the “move down” block should not work for the last element.

- Performance optimization (e.g., avoiding unnecessary renderings).

- Clean and well-organized code.

 

According to expectations

- The code should be readable and in line with best practices.

- The application should be functional and free of errors.

- The candidate should be able to explain their approach and design choices.
